# congestion
Congestion prediction models for CMA CGM

TODO IN GENERAL 

- try to develop an attention suited mechanism for congestion prediction (and number of boats) based on GAT
- search for needed try RNN models with a spatial graph part and to implement and test them
- think of appropriate adjacency in the network 

TODO CURRENT

- ohe-hot vectors labeling 
- tokenization of congestion 
- transformer decoder part
- transformer decoder? number of boats part 
- part of adjacency matrix as a number of routes between terminals 
- simple decoder with wrappers 
- congestion batches part 
- debugging tools (congestion visualisation)
